 COMPREHENSIVE DETAILS FOR EACH ASPECT

	1. POWER CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS:
		MG996R Servo Specifications:
			Operating voltage: 4.8V-7.2V
			Stall current: 2.5A (max)
			Running current: ~500mA-1.2A (depending on load)

		Total Power Requirements:
			Servos (6x):
				Peak current: 6 × 2.5A = 15A (theoretical max)
				Average running: 6 × 800mA = 4.8A
				Idle: 6 × 100mA = 0.6A

		Arduino Uno:
			Operating current: ~50mA
			With all pins active: ~100mA

		PCA9685 Servo Driver:
			Operating current: ~10mA

		Battery Calculations:
			Using 2x 18650 batteries in series (7.4V)
			Typical 18650 capacity: 2500mAh
			Expected runtime: ~30-45 minutes of continuous operation

Recommended: Keep spare charged batteries



	Key Assembly Notes:

		Use thick gauge wires (16-18 AWG) for power distribution
		Add capacitors (1000µF) near servo power connections
		Keep signal wires away from power wires to reduce interference
		Add heat sinks to voltage regulators
		Use screw terminals for main power connections
		Add fuse protection (10A) on main power line
