Design Guidelines:
- Use a professional, academic color scheme (suggested: blue, white, grey)
- Include relevant icons and diagrams
- Keep text concise and bullet-pointed
- Use consistent fonts (suggested: Arial for headings, Calibri for body)
- Include transition slides between major sections
- Add page numbers
- Include references slide at the end

Each slide should:
- Have clear headings
- Use minimal text (max 6 bullet points per slide)
- Include relevant visuals
- Maintain consistent branding
- Be easily readable from a distance

Additional Notes:
- Create smooth transitions between slides
- Include speaker notes where appropriate
- Ensure diagrams are simple and clear
- Use animations sparingly and professionally
